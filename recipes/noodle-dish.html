    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This noodle is a versatile and quick dish that features mince beef. The noodle is tossed with sautéed, earthy
        mushrooms and complementary sauces. <br />It can be prepared as a light side dish, a hearty main course, a
        stir-fry, or a soup</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>250g closed cup mushrooms</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2cm piece of ginger</li>
        <li>1 bunch of spring onions</li>
        <li>1 x 454g pack of frozen meat-free mince</li>
        <li>300g wholewheat noodles</li>
        <li>160g carrots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons reduced-salt soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop a handful of the mushrooms and pan-fry in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1
            teaspoon of oil
            until golden, stirring regularly, then set aside for later.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely grate the ginger. Finely slice the white part of the spring onions (reserving the
            green
            tops), then finely chop the rest of the mushrooms (or blitz in a food processor).</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil into the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high and add the meat-free mince,
            finely chopped
            mushrooms, ginger and spring onion whites. <br />Stir-fry for 20 minutes, or until the mince is gnarly and
            crispy,
            stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Finely chop the reserved spring onion tops, and
            scrub, trim and
            matchstick the carrots.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat, add the soy sauce, finely grate in the lime zest and squeeze over the juice.
        </li>
        <li>rain the noodles and divide between warm serving bowls, spoon over the mince mixture and the reserved golden
            mushrooms,
            sprinkle over the carrots and spring onion greens and serve.</li>
    </ol>
