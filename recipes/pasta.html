    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>Carbonara pasta is a rich and creamy dish made from eggs, Parmesan, pancetta/ or bacon, with a little olive oil
        and salt and pepper.<br>
        The silky carbonara sauce is created when the beaten eggs are tossed with the hot pasta and
        a little fat from the pancetta or bacon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large free-range egg yolks</li>
        <li>40g Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>1 x 150g piece of higher-welfare pancetta</li>
        <li>200g dried Pasta</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the egg yolks into a bowl, finely grate in the Parmesan, season with pepper, then mix well with a fork
            and put to
            one side.</li>
        <li>Cut any hard skin off the pancetta and set aside, then chop the meat.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a medium frying pan (this will add
            fantastic
            flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of oil instead), then place over a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic, then crush with the palm of your hand, add it to the pan and leave it to flavour the fat
            for 1 minute.
            Stir in the pancetta, then cook for 4 minutes, or until it starts to crisp up.</li>
        <li>Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the cooking water, drain and add the
            spaghetti.
            Toss well over the heat so it really soaks up all that lovely flavour, then remove the pan from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture – the pan
            will help to
            cook the egg gently, rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely and
            glossy.</li>
        <li>Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.</li>
    </ol>
