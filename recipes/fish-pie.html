    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fish pie is hearty, traditional British comfort food featuring a creamy sauce with mixed fish (like cod, haddock,
        salmon)<br /> and prawns, topped with a golden, buttery layer of mashed potatoes (often with cheese) and baked
        until bubbly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 x 1.5kg whole live lobster, from sustainable sources</li>

        <li>600ml semi-skimmed milk</li>

        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain flour</li>
        <li>50g Lancashire or Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2kg Maris Piper potatoes</li>
        <li> 75g Red Leicester cheese</li>
        <li>200g seasonal greens, such as kale, cavolo nero, chard</li>

        <li> 1kg mixed fish fillets and seafood, such as smoked haddock, scallops, salmon, bass, gurnard, lemon sole,
            skin off,
            pin-boned, from sustainable sources</li>

        <li> 10 raw peeled king prawns, from sustainable sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the live lobster in the freezer for 30 minutes, so it’s docile.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, carefully and swiftly place the lobster in a large pan of boiling water head first, pop
            the lid on
            and cook for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove, cool, and carefully halve the lobster, then remove the meat to a bowl – save the claws to decorate,
            if you like,
            or, even better, crack, pull out the meat and add it to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Put all the shells back into the empty pan you cooked the lobster in and bash with a rolling pin, then pour
            in the milk
            and simmer on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes to impart unbelievable flavour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel the onion and carrot, trim the fennel, wash the leek, finely chop it all and place in a
            large casserole
            pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter. <br />Cook for 15 minutes, or until soft
            and
            sticky,
            stirring regularly.</li>

    </ol>
